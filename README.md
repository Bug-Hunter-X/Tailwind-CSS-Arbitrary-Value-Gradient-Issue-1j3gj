# Tailwind CSS Arbitrary Value Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using arbitrary values within Tailwind CSS's gradient feature.  The issue is subtle and might not be immediately apparent to all users.

## Bug Description

The bug involves unexpected rendering when using arbitrary values within a gradient, potentially causing the gradient to not appear correctly or display different gradient behavior than expected.  This is particularly relevant when using multiple arbitrary values.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Node.js and npm (or yarn).
3. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
4. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Reproduction

Observe the rendered gradient.  The expected gradient should smoothly transition from blue to purple. If the gradient renders incorrectly or differently from expected, that demonstrates the bug.

## Solution

Refer to the file `bugSolution.js` for a potential solution.  This may involve ensuring that the syntax is accurate, and potentially using a different method for specifying the gradient (such as hex values) if the arbitrary values are causing incompatibility issues.
